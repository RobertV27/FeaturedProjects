# Evade

Author: Robert Villa



### What is "Evade"?
Evade is a 2D game. The player is a blue square that needs to move around in order
to dodge the black balls falling from above. Doing so, the player also needs 
to collect the green balls before the time printed on them expires. The player
can grab powerups to improve there ability to survive for a short period of time.
The small light-blue square is a powerup that allows the player to jump higher, and
the small pink square is a powerup that allows the player to move faster. The score
is determined based on the amount time the player is able to stay alive.

### How to Get Evade
In order to play Evade, CLion, Cinder, and Box2D are required. In order to get
JetBrains C++ IDE: CLion, you need to visit this link: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/.
You will also need the Cinder framework which is available at this link:
https://libcinder.org/download. Once the Cinder file downloads, you will need to build
the Cinder library. This is done by extracting the downloaded file into a folder, opening
that folder in CLion, and clicking build. The Box2D CinderBlock should be accessible
without an additional steps. However, if this is not the case it is available at 
this link: https://github.com/cinder/Cinder/tree/master/blocks/Box2D. In order to use the
CinderBlock, you will need to clone it into the "blocks" directory of your Cinder folder.
