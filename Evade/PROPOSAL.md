# Evade

### Project Overview
For my final project, I would like to make a game. Specifically, I would like
to make a dodging game where black balls drop from the ceiling, and the player
below has to move to dodge them. The floor and walls in the game world will be
solid. This means that the player will have to continuously dodge the balls as
they bounce around the screen. Overtime, these balls will get smaller and smaller,
until they eventually disappear from the screen. The player loses when they are
hit by one of these balls, and the player's score will be calculated based on
the amount of time they have survived. Additionally, I would like to include
green balls that drop from the ceiling. These green balls would need to be collected
in a specific amount of time or the player would lose. Furthermore, I would also
like to include an powerups that the player can collect to make the game easier
for a short period of time I imagine the graphics being fairly similar in quality to
the snake project we worked on.
### Background Knowledge and Motivation
The only background knowledge I have in C++ is from the projects we have done in
class. I coded ultimate tic tac toe for my final project in CS125. On top of that,
I created a powerup feature in the snake project. Doing so, I learned to better work
with graphics and user inputs. I want to do this project because I think it has a good
level of difficulty for the amount of time we have. I also think that doing this
project will help me learn a lot of new things about graphics and the basics of
game development. Furthermore, I think it is an interesting project that I will
have fun coding.
### External Library
I am planning on using a physics library as my external c++ library. Specifically,
I want to use Box2D, https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D. This library should
allow me to identify object collisions and help me code the movement of the balls.
It will also allow me to add gravity to the game world.
### Timeline
At the end of week 1, I am planning to have the basic plan and structure of my
code done. Along with this, I also am hoping to get the spawn and movement of
the black balls complete. At the end of week 2, I am hoping to include a moveable
player with hit detection and a system that keeps track of a player's scores.
During the final week, I am planning on adding the additional features: powerups
and the green balls. Some "stretch goals"  I have are a main menu where you can 
choose the difficulty of the game, a pause button, and leaderboard. This leaderboard
would be similar to the one we created in the snake project.
